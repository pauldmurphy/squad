# Orchestration Log

> Filled in by the Coordinator for every agent spawn. Append each entry below.

## Entry Template

### {timestamp} — {task summary}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent routed** | {Name} ({Role}) |
| **Why chosen** | {Routing rationale — what in the request matched this agent} |
| **Files authorized to read** | {Exact file paths the agent was told to read} |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | {Exact file paths the agent is expected to create or modify} |
| **Outcome** | {Completed / Rejected by {Reviewer} / Escalated} |

---

## Rules

1. **One entry per agent spawn.** If two agents are spawned for one request, log two entries.
2. **Log BEFORE spawning.** The entry must exist before the agent runs.
3. **Update outcome AFTER the agent completes.** Fill in the Outcome field.
4. **Never delete or edit past entries.** Append-only.
5. **If a reviewer rejects work,** log the rejection as a new entry with the revision agent.
