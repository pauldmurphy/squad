# What's New

Full release history for Squad. For the latest version, see [README](../README.md).

## v0.5.2

- **`upgrade --migrate-directory` exits early fix** — The directory rename step no longer calls `process.exit(0)`, so the full upgrade (squad.agent.md, workflows, .ai-team-templates) now runs after migration in one command
- **`.slnx`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj` not detected as .NET** — Proper Visual Studio solution files and F#/VB.NET project files now detected; repos using these get proper dotnet stub CI workflows
- **Migrations use detected squad directory** — Migration steps and `.gitattributes` rules now use the detected squad directory (`.squad/` or `.ai-team/`) so they work correctly after `--migrate-directory` runs

## v0.5.1

- [**`squad watch` — Local Watchdog**](../docs/features/ralph.md#watch-mode) — Persistent polling for unattended work processing. Run `npx github:bradygaster/squad watch` to check GitHub every 10 minutes for untriaged squad work; use `--interval` flag to customize polling (e.g., `squad watch --interval 5` for 5-minute polling). Runs until Ctrl+C.
- **Project type detection** — Squad now detects your project's language and stack (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, .NET, etc.) to intelligently configure workflows
- **Git safety rules** — Guardrails enforced based on detected project type to prevent common mistakes and state corruption

## v0.5.0 — The `.squad/` Rename Release

- [**`.ai-team/` renamed to `.squad/`**](../docs/migration/v0.5.0-squad-rename.md) — Full directory rename with backward-compatible migration utilities. Existing repos continue to work; migration required by v1.0.0.
- [**Decision lifecycle management**](../docs/features/decision-lifecycle.md) — Archival and versioning support for design decisions across the agent lifecycle
- **Identity layer** — New `wisdom.md` and `now.md` files for agent context and temporal awareness
- **ISO 8601 UTC timestamps** — Standardized timestamp format throughout (decision dates, agent updates, metadata)
- **Cold-path extraction** — Refactored `squad.agent.md` into active decision paths and on-demand satellite files, reducing coordinator size from ~30KB to ~17KB
- **Skills export/import verification** — Enhanced validation and documentation for agent skill extension
- **Email scrubbing** — Automatic PII removal during migration to prevent accidental email commits

## v0.4.2

- **`/agent` vs `/agents` CLI command fix** — README and install output now correctly reference `/agent` (the CLI command) instead of `/agents` (VS Code shortcut)
- [**Insider Program infrastructure**](../docs/insider-program.md) — `insider` branch with guard workflow enforcement; forbidden paths blocked from protected branches to maintain code safety
- **Branch content policy** — Formal decision document defining which files belong on main, preview, and insider branches; includes 5-step branch creation checklist
- **Custom universe support** — Star Trek universe added by community contributor @codebytes

## v0.4.1

- **Task spawn UI** — Added role emoji to task descriptions for visual consistency; 11 role patterns mapped to emoji (🏗️ Lead, 🔧 Backend, ⚛️ Frontend, 🧪 Tester, etc.)
- **Ralph heartbeat workflow syntax fix** — Removed duplicate `issues:` trigger keys in `squad-heartbeat.yml`; combined into single trigger
- **Community page links fixed** — GitHub Discussions links now work correctly (Discussions enabled on repo)
- [**`squad upgrade --self` command**](../docs/scenarios/upgrading.md) — New flag for refreshing squad repo's own `.ai-team/` from templates; preserves agent history
- **Deprecation banner for .ai-team/ → .squad/ rename** — CLI and coordinator warn users that v0.5.0 will rename `.ai-team/` to `.squad/`
- **Stale workflow references fixed** — All documentation updated to reference correct `squad-heartbeat.yml` filename

## v0.4.0

- [**Client Compatibility**](../docs/scenarios/client-compatibility.md) — Full platform support matrix. Squad now works on CLI and VS Code with graceful degradation.

- [**Project Boards**](../docs/features/project-boards.md) — GitHub Projects V2 integration. Board + Kanban views synced from labels. `gh auth refresh -s project` required.
- [**Label Taxonomy**](../docs/features/labels.md) — 7-namespace label system (status:, type:, priority:, squad:, go:, release:, era:). Labels are the state machine; boards are projections.
- [**Notifications**](../docs/features/notifications.md) — Your squad pings you on Teams, iMessage, or Discord when they need input. Zero infrastructure in Squad — bring your own MCP notification server.
- [**MCP Setup Guide**](../docs/features/mcp.md) — Step-by-step MCP configuration for CLI and VS Code. Examples: GitHub, Trello, Aspire dashboard.

- **Context Optimization** — decisions.md pruned from ~80K to ~33K tokens (251 → 78 blocks). Spawn templates deduplicated. Per-agent context usage dropped from 41–46% to 17–23%. Agents now have 78–83% of their context window for actual work.
- **Core Growth** — squad.agent.md: 1,100 → 1,771 lines; index.js: 654 lines; 188+ total commits

## v0.3.0

- [**Per-Agent Model Selection**](../docs/features/model-selection.md) — Cost-first routing: code work gets standard-tier models (claude-sonnet-4.5), non-code tasks use fast/cheap models (claude-haiku-4.5). 16-model catalog with fallback chains.
- [**Ralph — Work Monitor**](../docs/features/ralph.md) — Built-in squad member that autonomously processes backlogs. Self-chaining work loop: scan GitHub → spawn agents → collect results → repeat.

- **Universe Expansion** — 14 → 20 casting universes (Succession, Severance, Lord of the Rings, Attack on Titan, Doctor Who, Monty Python)
