# #9 on GitHub Trending Developers

> _Squad hit #9 on GitHub Trending Developers today, February 19. Started February 7. 12 days from launch to GitHub's top trending._

## What Happened

This morning, Brady discovered that Squad is the **#9 trending developer** on GitHub. The repo `bradygaster/squad` is the featured project.

The full trending list includes some company. Agentsys is at #3 with 42 agents and 13 plugins. Agent-of-empires is at #4 (Claude Code terminal session manager). Inbox-zero (AI email) is at #8. TinyUSB, Voicebox, and others fill the remainder.

The AI agent wave is real. And Squad is riding it.

## Timeline

- **February 7** — Squad launched. First commit. First deploy.
- **February 11** — Jeff Fritz published the first public video demo (131 passing tests).
- **February 15** — v0.2.0 shipped. Skills system + export/import. Five new blog posts.
- **February 19** — Trending Developers #9.

12 days. No marketing. No announcement. Just a team building in public and a community that showed up.

## What's Happening

The GitHub Trending list measures stars over a rolling window. The signal is real: people are starring Squad. Reading the repos they're linking, they're:

- **Trying it** — Cloning, running `npx create-squad`, spinning up teams
- **Building with it** — Deploying Squad into real repos. Shipping real work with agent teams
- **Talking about it** — Sharing links, testing variations, reporting bugs, suggesting features

The #9 spot is not a vanity metric. It's verification that the message landed: "Your code needs a team. Squad gives you one. Go build something."

## Why Now

Three things converged:

1. **The agent moment.** The industry moved from "AI writes code" (Copilot, Cursor) to "AI runs code" (Claude Code, Windsurf) to "AI **teams** write code" (Squad, agentsys, agent-of-empires). Users want delegation, not autocomplete. This wave lifted all boats.

2. **The cast system.** The fact that agents have names, personalities, and persistent decisions — they're not generic numbered workers — is memorable. Developers talk about "our squad" the way they talk about "our team." Casting turned the abstract into the familiar.

3. **Transparency.** Everything Squad creates lives in markdown in your repo. Decisions, history, skills, cast definitions — all visible, inspectable, portable. No proprietary databases. No lock-in. This built trust fast.

## What This Unlocks

Trending changes three things:

**Discovery** — Developers who would never have found Squad now see it. First-time visitors are coming to the README with an open mind.

**Credibility** — Being #9 on GitHub is a third-party validation. "If GitHub's trending list cares, I should probably pay attention."

**Momentum** — Contributors, collaborators, and future squad members now know where to look. The project has visibility. Building Squad in public just became building Squad with an audience.

## What's Next

This is a moment-in-time milestone. The real work is what happens after trending dies down — and it will. Trending is a sprint, not a strategy. The test is: Do people who starred today still use Squad in March? Do they file issues? Do they contribute? Do they build teams?

That's where the real story unfolds.

The 12-day arc from launch to #9 trending means one thing: we built something people genuinely want. Now we prove we can deliver on that promise.
