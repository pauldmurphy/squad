# Orchestration Log: Fenster (Core Dev)

**Date:** 2026-02-20T15:47:07Z  
**Agent:** Fenster  
**Mode:** Background  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5  

## Assignment

Technical SDK-to-Squad runtime mapping. Deep analysis of `@github/copilot-sdk` source (3,162 lines), feature mapping, complexity assessment, and implementation roadmap.

## Output

- **Decision Record:** `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/fenster-sdk-technical-mapping.md`
- **Technical Analysis:** `.ai-team/docs/sdk-technical-mapping.md` (24KB)

## Decision Summary

**SDK Replatforming — Technical Viability & Recommendation**

Recommend proceeding with SDK replatforming. SDK is highly viable with ~75% direct feature mapping and significant maintainability/capability gains.

**Key Findings:**
- Direct mappings: Agent spawning, system messages, tool control, MCP integration, infinite sessions, model selection
- Squad-specific: Casting system, decision inbox pattern, Ralph work monitor, template installer, tier-based response modes
- New capabilities: Multi-session management, session resumption, streaming deltas, protocol negotiation, BYOK, hooks, skills
- Implementation estimate: 19-26 hours across 5 phases (2.5–3.5 days)

**Status:** Recommend approval pending Brady review.

## Outcome

Technical feasibility confirmed. Implementation path clear.
