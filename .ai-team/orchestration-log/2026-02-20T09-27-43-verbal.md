# Orchestration Log: Verbal (Prompt Engineer)

**Agent:** Verbal  
**Role:** Prompt Engineer  
**Branch:** `squad/86-prevent-git-checkout-data-loss`  
**Mode:** background  
**Date:** 2026-02-20T09:27:43Z  

## Work Completed

- Added Git Safety rules to `squad.agent.md` spawn templates and Fenster charter
- Implemented uncommitted-change protection directives in spawn prompts
- Updated all spawn templates with safety-first guidance for git operations
- All 72 tests pass

## Outcome

✅ Success. All tests pass.

## Key Files Modified

- `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` — spawn templates updated with Git Safety rules
- `.ai-team/agents/fenster/charter.md` — Git Safety section added to Fenster's role
- `test/git-safety.test.js` — supported by Hockney's regression test suite

## Decisions Merged

None — git safety is operational guidance, not architectural decision.

## Cross-Agent Notes

Verbal and Fenster worked the same issue (#86). Hockney wrote 8 regression tests in `test/git-safety.test.js` to validate the safety rules.
