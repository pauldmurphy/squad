# Orchestration Log: Kujan (SDK Expert)

**Date:** 2026-02-20T22:03:59Z  
**Session:** Spawn-based work  
**Output:** `.ai-team/docs/feature-comparison.md`

## What Was Done

Completed exhaustive feature comparison of current Squad (62 features) vs. SDK-replatformed Squad. Document structured for McManus to produce diagrams.

## Key Findings

- **18 GRAVE features** — zero PRD coverage, will be silently lost
- **12 AT RISK features** — partial coverage, degradation risk
- **28 COVERED features** — tracked in PRDs
- **5 INTENTIONAL** — no coverage needed
- **8 new SDK capability categories** unlocked

## Key Decisions

- CustomAgentConfig is the natural mapping for Squad team members
- 4-phase migration estimated 17–26 weeks total
- 6 blocking decisions needed from Brady

## Status

Complete. Feature comparison ready for Brady checkpoint. Pending Brady decisions on:
1. Package name for npm registry
2. Model fallback chain spec per tier
3. Provider override scope
4. Quota routing
5. OTLP export
6. PRD 16 scope (export/import vs. combined with marketplace)
