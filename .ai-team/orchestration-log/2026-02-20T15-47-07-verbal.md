## Assignment

Agent design impact analysis. Evaluate how SDK replatforming transforms agent lifecycle, governance, memory, and observability. Recommend design patterns and POC scope.

## Decision Summary

**SDK Agent Design Strategy**

Replatforming Squad on Copilot SDK transforms agents from ephemeral spawns into persistent session objects with SDK-managed lifecycle, hooks for governance, and real-time event streaming.

**Recommendation:** Start with POC branch:
1. Port Scribe (simplest agent) to SDK session
2. Implement onPostToolUse hook for decision capture
3. Compare DX: spawn vs. session lifecycle
4. Measure: real-time observability, memory persistence, governance enforcement

**If POC succeeds:** Migrate incrementally, maintain CLI-spawn fallback until SDK parity proven.

**Key Implications:**
- Agent sessions replace spawns (persistent CopilotSession objects)
- Charters compile to CustomAgentConfigs at runtime
- Hooks formalize governance (onPreToolUse, onPostToolUse, onSessionStart)
- Multi-session orchestration with real-time visibility
- Infinite sessions enable agent memory persistence

**Status:** Proposal. Recommends Scribe POC for session lifecycle validation.

## Outcome

Design strategy approved. POC scope validated. Ready to implement.
