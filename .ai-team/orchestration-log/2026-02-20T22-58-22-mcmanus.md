# Orchestration Log — McManus

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-20T22:58:22Z  
**Agent:** McManus (DevRel)  
**Mode:** background  
**Task:** Blog/docs strategy + v1 stamping plan

## Outcome

**✅ COMPLETE**

Created two strategic documents:

1. **`.ai-team/docs/v1-content-strategy.md`** (18.6KB)
   - v1 stamping convention (code comments, badges, blog tags, CHANGELOG emojis)
   - Blog cadence: 9 posts over 32 weeks (M0 spike → M1-M2 runtime → M3-M4 parity → M5-M6 launch)
   - Documentation plan per milestone (M0 internal-only → M6 launch-ready)
   - File placement rules (`.ai-team/docs/` internal, `docs/` public, root pristine)
   - Content migration plan (inventory, rollback, repo-split contingency)

2. **`.ai-team/docs/crossover-vision-mcmanus.md`** (18.3KB)
   - Messaging arc: ACT 1 Confidence, ACT 2 Continuity, ACT 3 Clarity
   - v0.6.0 README vision (16-section structure for 5-minute comprehension)
   - Universe selection: **Usual Suspects (locked in)** — existing characters, tone match, memorable, extensible
   - Voice of first Squad (standards now = inherited by every future squad's DevRel)

Filed decision to inbox: `mcmanus-v1-strategy.md`

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ v1 stamping convention adopted (all SDK work tagged "v1" in code/docs/blogs)
- ✅ Blog cadence fixed (9 posts aligned to milestones, facts-only tone)
- ✅ File placement finalized (permanent policy: .ai-team/ internal, docs/ public, root clean)
- ✅ Universe locked to Usual Suspects (no switching at cutover)
- ✅ README redesigned as 16-section structure (hero → quick-start → why → parallel → how → casting → files → grow → reviewer → install → troubleshooting → status)

**Status:** Awaiting Brady approval for blog implementation (starting M0 spike post, week 4).
