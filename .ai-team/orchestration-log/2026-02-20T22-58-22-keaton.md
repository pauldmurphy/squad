# Orchestration Log — Keaton

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-20T22:58:22Z  
**Agent:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Mode:** background  
**Task:** Crossover vision + architecture carry-forward

## Outcome

**✅ COMPLETE**

Created `.ai-team/docs/crossover-vision-keaton.md` (14.2KB) covering:

- Load-bearing architecture patterns (distributed context, proposal-first governance, per-agent memory, casting system, ceremonies)
- What's being left behind (two-directory problem, duplicate agents, proposal overhead, manual decision merging)
- Squad v1 redesigned from scratch (5-core agents, flat directory structure, SDK contracts, coordinator replatforming, 4-core ceremonies, skills as first-class)
- Transition gates (3 phases: M0 validation → M1 capabilities → M3 feature parity, March–June timeline)
- First squad of many responsibility (documentation, monitoring, fix gaps in SDK not Squad, maintain Squad Patterns doc, adopt SDK features first, design for customization)

Filed decision to inbox: `keaton-crossover-vision.md`

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ 5-core agent structure for v1 (Keaton, Fenster, Verbal, Baer, Hockney)
- ✅ .squad/ as canonical directory (retire .ai-team/ support)
- ✅ Automation of decision merging (Scribe workflow)
- ✅ 3-phase transition gates with measurable exit criteria
- ✅ Reference implementation commitment (new squads fork from v1)

**Dependencies:** Brady's 4 directives (repo cleanliness, v1 stamping, new squad at cutover, universe self-selection), SDK replatform PRDs, milestone timeline.
