## Work Item
Fixed #134: Content replacement in `--migrate-directory` flow.

## Changes
- Added `replaceAiTeamReferences(dirPath)` function to migrate-directory.js
- Recursively processes .md and .json files in migrated directories
- Replaces `.ai-team-templates/` → `.squad-templates/`, then `.ai-team/` → `.squad/`
- Runs after email scrub step during migration
- Reusable pattern following established `scrubEmailsFromDirectory()` approach

## Verification
- PR #151 merged to dev branch
- All 95 tests pass
- Migration paths now point to correct .squad/ locations

## Decision Captured
Decision filed to inbox: `fenster-migrate-content-replacement.md` (issue #134, PR #151)
