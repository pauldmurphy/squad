# Orchestration Log: Fenster (Core Developer)

**Agent:** Fenster  
**Role:** Core Developer, Infrastructure  
**Branch:** `squad/87-project-type-detection`  
**Mode:** background  
**Date:** 2026-02-20T09:27:43Z  

## Work Completed

- Implemented `detectProjectType()` function in `index.js` to auto-detect project type
- Implemented `generateProjectWorkflowStub()` for non-npm project types (Go, Python, .NET, Java/Kotlin)
- Updated workflow generation logic to stub non-npm/unknown project types with helpful TODO comments
- Updated init, upgrade, and upgrade-already-current paths to use project-type-aware workflow logic
- Marker file detection: package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, *.csproj, *.sln
- All 64 tests pass

## Outcome

✅ Success. 64/64 tests pass. Project type detection is now live in `index.js`.

## Key Files Modified

- `index.js` — `detectProjectType()`, `generateProjectWorkflowStub()`, workflow copy dispatch
- `test/workflows.test.js` — 2 tests updated to add package.json to temp dirs before init
- `.ai-team/agents/fenster/charter.md` — Git Safety section added (see Verbal's work on #86)

## Decisions Merged

**Decision: Project Type Detection for Workflow Generation** — See `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/fenster-project-type-detection.md` for full details.

## Cross-Agent Notes

Fenster and Verbal worked on overlapping concerns: Fenster added project-type detection (#87), Verbal added Git Safety rules to spawn templates (#86). Hockney's tests validate safety guarantees. All three agents coordinate on branch `squad/86-prevent-git-checkout-data-loss` / `squad/87-project-type-detection` (note: may be different branches, both work is valid).
