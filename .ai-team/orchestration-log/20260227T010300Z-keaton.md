# Keaton — Orchestration Log
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-27T01:03:00Z  
**Session:** repo-cleanup  
**Role:** Lead (Analysis & Recommendation)

## Work Done

- Analyzed branch divergence between main (21 commits, release work) and dev (45K+ lines, squad-sdk planning)
- Identified misplaced commit fc9d7db on main (skills that belong on dev)
- Evaluated three sync strategies: merge-dev-to-main (rejected), merge-main-to-dev (risky), cherry-pick-to-dev + reset-main (recommended)
- Produced structured cleanup plan with 4 phases and risk analysis
- Decision output: `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/keaton-repo-cleanup.md`

## Recommendation

Execute Phase 1 (cherry-pick fc9d7db to dev, reset main) immediately. Defer Phases 2–3 (branch/stash cleanup) pending team decision.

## Status

✅ Analysis complete. Decision documented.
