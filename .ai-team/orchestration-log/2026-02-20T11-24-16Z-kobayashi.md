# Orchestration Entry: Kobayashi — Git Risk Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-20T11:24:16Z  
**Agent:** Kobayashi (Release Engineer)  
**Spawn Mode:** Background  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Task

Security/safety audit: identify git-side risks in `upgrade --migrate-directory` flow.

## Deliverable

Audit report covering:
- Directory rename implications for git history/blame
- Uncommitted changes risk
- Guard workflow interaction
- .gitattributes update safety

## Outcome

✅ **Git Risk Report Complete**

**Risks Identified:**
1. **Filesystem rename ≠ Git rename** — blame/history broken, requires explicit `git mv`
2. **Uncommitted changes orphaned** — if user has unstaged changes in .ai-team/, they move to .squad/ but git is unaware
3. **Guard workflow blocks merging to main** — intentional by design, but users must be warned
4. **.gitattributes update not staged** — git uses old merge rules until staged

**Grade:** CONDITIONAL SAFE — users must follow explicit git instructions or risk losing history.
