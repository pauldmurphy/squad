# Orchestration Log — Kujan

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-20T22:58:22Z  
**Agent:** Kujan (SDK Expert)  
**Mode:** background  
**Task:** SDK expertise carry-forward + new world technical notes

## Outcome

**✅ COMPLETE**

Created `.ai-team/docs/crossover-vision-kujan.md` (26KB knowledge transfer) covering:

1. **SDK carry-forward** — Hard guarantees, hard constraints, session management quirks, tool registration patterns, model selection, cost handling
2. **Platform evolution predictions** — 18–24 month roadmap (session-level multi-tenancy, per-agent hooks, MCP health API, cost data, streaming chunks)
3. **Technical debt** — What to leave behind (prompt-level platform detection, manual session context, hardcoded model catalog, polling-based status, charter inlining at scale, regex decision parsing)
4. **SDK-native possibilities** — What becomes possible with coordinator as executable code (v0.7.0+): declarative tool namespacing, enforced cost governance, skill plugins, portable squad composition, multi-repo squads
5. **Universe selection** — Kujan selects: **Coordinator Runtime Architect** in v1.0.0 (owns executor coordinator, event-driven architecture, session management, cost governance, gates-as-code)
6. **Lessons for future SDK experts** — 10 critical insights (event streams > docs, session-scoped thinking limiting, tool collision load-bearing, MCP health gap, fallback chains manual, version pinning discipline, streaming conditional, filesystem memory essential, latency under load architectural, institutional knowledge care)

Filed decision to inbox: `kujan-crossover-vision.md`

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ Coordinator Runtime Architect role for v1 (unclaimed specialist piece, deep code ownership)
- ✅ Event streams as primary platform signal (vs. docs/polling)
- ✅ Filesystem memory non-negotiable (vs. SDK abstractions)
- ✅ Platform evolution roadmap documented for v0.6.0–v1.0.0

**Next:** Document handed off to Brady for v1 squad onboarding. New SDK expert reads section 6 on day one.
