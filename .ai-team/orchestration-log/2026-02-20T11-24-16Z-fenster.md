# Orchestration Entry: Fenster — v0.5.0 Investigation

**Date:** 2026-02-20T11:24:16Z  
**Agent:** Fenster (Core Developer)  
**Spawn Mode:** Background  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Task

Reproduce v0.5.0 upgrade behavior on SqncR test repository to verify reported issues.

## Deliverable

Full test report documenting:
- `upgrade` (without --migrate-directory) behavior
- `upgrade --migrate-directory` behavior
- Directory state, file changes, git status after each command
- Critical observations about incomplete migrations

## Outcome

✅ **Issue Confirmed:** `--migrate-directory` performs directory migration and email scrubbing but **does NOT upgrade files** (squad.agent.md, workflows, templates remain at v0.3.0).

**Key Finding:** Two-step process required for complete upgrade:
1. `upgrade --migrate-directory` → renames .ai-team/ → .squad/
2. `upgrade` → updates coordinator, workflows, templates

**Document Location:** `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/fenster-v050-migration-findings.md`
