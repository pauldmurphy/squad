# Orchestration Entry: Verbal — Migration Flow Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-20T11:24:16Z  
**Agent:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)  
**Spawn Mode:** Background  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Task

Code review: analyze `upgrade --migrate-directory` flow for logic issues.

## Deliverable

Detailed analysis of:
- Early exit behavior and its consequences
- Email scrubbing bug (0.5.0 migration assumes .ai-team/ still exists)
- Missing documented path for "migrate AND upgrade"
- Workflow generation for .NET projects

## Outcome

✅ **Logic Analysis Complete**

**Issues Identified:**
1. Early exit prevents normal upgrade (users need 2 commands, not documented)
2. 0.5.0 migration silently fails when .ai-team/ has been renamed to .squad/
3. Help text misleading about what --migrate-directory does
4. No documented single-command workflow for users

**Root Cause:** Design rationale treats --migrate-directory as single-purpose, but conflicts with user expectations.
