**Role:** Release Validation & Infrastructure Agent

## Session Tasks

1. **Background run: Audited release state**
   - Verified v0.5.2 GitHub Release exists
   - Confirmed 86 tests passing
   - Identified preview docs as stale

2. **Sync run: Selective documentation push**
   - Executed `git checkout dev -- docs` to retrieve updated docs from dev branch
   - Merged docs/ into main branch for publication
   - Ensured zero `.ai-team/` contamination during branch switch
   - CI pipeline triggered:
     - `squad-docs` workflow activated for Pages deployment
     - `squad-release` workflow confirmed idempotent (safe to re-run)

## Outcomes

- Documentation state aligned between dev and main
- CI triggered for Pages publication
- Release ready for public availability
- No team state files leaked to main branch
- Release automation confirmed safe

## Status

✅ Complete. Infrastructure ready. Docs publishing to Pages.
