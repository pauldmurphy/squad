**Session:** Spawn-based work  
**Output:** `.ai-team/docs/milestones.md`

## What Was Done

Created comprehensive SDK replatform milestones document organizing 14 PRDs into 6 shippable milestones across 3 phases (~32 weeks, v0.6.0 to v0.6.0 release).

## Key Outputs

- **`.ai-team/docs/milestones.md`** — 6 milestones with critical path, work items, owners, effort estimates, exit criteria, risk mitigation
- **`.ai-team/decisions/inbox/keaton-milestones.md`** — Decision record for Brady approval

## Decisions Made

- M0 (Foundation) is the gate — SDK viability must be proven before proceeding
- M3 (Feature Parity) must pass Brady checkpoint before final launch phase
- All 27 resolved decisions (Q19–Q27) embedded in milestone work items
- Feature risk punch list (14 GRAVE + 12 AT RISK) explicitly addressed

## Status

Complete. Document ready for Brady review and approval.
