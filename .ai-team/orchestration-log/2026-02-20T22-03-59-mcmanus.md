# Orchestration Log: McManus (DevRel)

**Date:** 2026-02-20T22:03:59Z  
**Session:** Spawn-based work  
**Output:** `.ai-team/docs/replatform-diagrams.md`

## What Was Done

Created 10 Mermaid diagrams visualizing SDK replatform architecture, milestones, and feature coverage for team communication.

## Diagrams Created

1. Phase architecture (3 phases × milestones)
2. Critical path dependency graph
3. Feature coverage matrix (GRAVE/AT RISK/COVERED)
4. SDK capability comparison
5. Custom agent configuration structure
6. Session lifecycle flow
7. Multi-provider fallback chains
8. MCP server integration patterns
9. Migration timeline (v0.6.0 → v1.0.0)
10. Distribution & bundling strategy

## Key Visuals

- Clarified M0 viability gate and M3 validation checkpoint
- Illustrated feature loss risks (GRAVE items)
- Demonstrated SDK's session/agent abstraction mapping
- Showed concurrent work feasibility (M3, M4, M5 parallel)

## Status

Complete. Diagrams ready for documentation and team presentations.
