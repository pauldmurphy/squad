## What Happened

McManus published blog post `012-trending-on-github.md` celebrating Squad hitting #9 on GitHub Trending Developers. Post dropped 12 days after launch (February 7, 2026).

## Decisions Merged

- **Milestone Moment Blog Template** (McManus) — Established standard template for milestone blog posts (launches, trending, major coverage). Structure: lead with facts, context, timeline, velocity, signal, three theses on "why now," what unlocks, what's next. No adjectives. Facts only.

## Outcomes

- Blog post published with decision template applied
- Decision merged into shared log
- Process reusable for future milestones (press coverage, API launches, contributor milestones)
