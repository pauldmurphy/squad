# Session Log: 2026-02-20 PRD Gap Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-20T22:28Z  
**Agent:** Kujan (SDK Expert)  
**Duration:** Single spawn  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary
Kujan audited all 16 "None" items in `feature-comparison.md` against PRD text (PRDs 1-14):
- **1 item**: Already covered, mapping error only → Update feature-comparison.md
- **10 items**: Covered by existing PRDs but implicit → PRD owners add sections
- **5 items**: Requires new PRDs 15 & 16 → Assigned scope, awaiting Brady decision

## Key Findings
- PRD 15 (@copilot agent roster): CLI-6, CLI-7, CLI-8 — Phase 2, tightly coupled feature
- PRD 16 (portable squads export/import): CLI-13, CLI-14 — Proposal 008 alignment
- Specific PRD additions needed in PRDs 4, 8, 12, 14 (2-3 sentences each)

## Decisions Made
- Approved PRD 15 scope: agent roster management + capability profiling
- Approved PRD 16 scope: portable squad export/import
- Feature-comparison.md updated with all mappings
- PRD index updated

## Deliverables
- ✅ Updated `feature-comparison.md`
- ✅ Created `.ai-team/docs/prd-gap-resolutions.md`
- ✅ Decision inbox: `kujan-prd-gap-audit.md`

## Next: Brady Decision
1. PRD 15 & 16 owners assignment
2. Timeline confirmation (Phase 2 or Phase 3)
3. PRD owner assignments for section additions
