# Planning Deliverables Session

**Date:** 2026-02-20T22:03:59Z

## Spawn Summary

Three agents spawned in background mode:

- **Keaton (Lead)** — Created `.ai-team/docs/milestones.md` with 6 milestones organizing 14 PRDs across 3 phases (~32w). M0 viability gate documented. Effort estimates, exit criteria, risk mitigation complete.
- **Kujan (SDK Expert)** — Delivered `.ai-team/docs/feature-comparison.md` with exhaustive feature inventory. 62 features mapped: 18 GRAVE (no PRD), 12 AT RISK, 28 covered, 5 intentional. 6 blocking Brady decisions identified.
- **McManus (DevRel)** — Produced `.ai-team/docs/replatform-diagrams.md` with 10 Mermaid diagrams for team communication and planning visualization.

## Key Outcomes

✅ Planning gate deliverables complete  
✅ Feature risk quantified (14 GRAVE items acknowledged)  
✅ Blocking decisions surfaced (Brady checkpoint required)  
✅ Milestone structure ready for execution (pending Brady approval)

## Next Steps

Brady review and approval of milestones document (planning gate). No implementation begins until Brady signals "Go" on M0 kickoff.
