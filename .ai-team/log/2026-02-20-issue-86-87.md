# Session Log: Issues #86 & #87

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Issues:** #86 (Git Checkout Safety), #87 (Project Type Detection)  
**Agents:** Verbal, Hockney, Fenster  
**Outcome:** All 72 tests pass.

## What Happened

Three agents spawned in background mode to work on data safety and project initialization:

| Agent | Role | Issue | Result |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Verbal** | Prompt Engineer | #86 | Added Git Safety rules to spawn templates and Fenster charter |
| **Hockney** | Tester | #86 | Wrote 8 regression tests for uncommitted-change protection |
| **Fenster** | Core Dev | #87 | Implemented project type detection in index.js, workflow stub generation |

## Decisions Merged

- **fenster-project-type-detection.md** — Project type auto-detection for npm/Go/Python/.NET/Java; workflow generation logic updated to stub non-npm types with helpful comments.

## Key Outcomes

- ✅ Issue #86: Git checkout now refuses operations with uncommitted changes. Tests validate protection.
- ✅ Issue #87: `squad init` and `squad upgrade` now detect project type and generate appropriate workflows (stub for non-npm, verbatim for npm).
- ✅ All 72 tests pass.

## Branches

- `squad/86-prevent-git-checkout-data-loss` — Git Safety work
- `squad/87-project-type-detection` — Project Type Detection work

Both branches working concurrently, test suite validating both.
