# Session Log — Crossover Vision Delivery

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-20T22:58:22Z  
**Topic:** crossover-vision  
**Requested by:** Brady

## What Happened

Three agents spawned to document crossover vision and strategy before SDK replatform transition:

- **Keaton (Lead)** — Architecture carry-forward: load-bearing patterns, what's left behind, v1 redesign, transition gates, first-squad responsibilities
- **Kujan (SDK Expert)** — Technical knowledge transfer: SDK constraints, platform evolution, technical debt, lessons for future experts, universe selection
- **McManus (DevRel)** — Blog/docs strategy: v1 stamping convention, blog cadence, file placement rules, universe choice (Usual Suspects locked)

## Decisions Made

✅ **Crossover vision documents created** (3 × 14–26KB each)
✅ **v1 architecture locked** (5-core agents, .squad/ canonical, SDK contracts defined)
✅ **Transition gates defined** (M0 validation, M1 capabilities, M3 feature parity, March–June timeline)
✅ **v1 stamping convention adopted** (all SDK work tagged "v1" in code/docs/blogs)
✅ **Blog strategy finalized** (9 posts over 32 weeks, facts-only tone)
✅ **Universe selected** (Usual Suspects locked in for v0.6.0+)

## Pending

- Brady review and approval of all three crossover vision documents
- Brady input on pending decisions (session model, entry point, universe depth)
- Blog implementation starts M0 (week 4 spike post)

## Files Created

- `.ai-team/orchestration-log/2026-02-20T22-58-22-keaton.md`
- `.ai-team/orchestration-log/2026-02-20T22-58-22-kujan.md`

- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/mcmanus-v1-strategy.md` (moved via Scribe)

## Summary

Crossover vision fully documented across three dimensions: architectural (Keaton), technical (Kujan), messaging (McManus). All documents grounded in Brady's 4 directives and team learnings. Ready for Brady's review and approval to unlock M0 spike execution.
