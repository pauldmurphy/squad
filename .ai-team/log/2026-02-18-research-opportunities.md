# Session: Research Opportunities Documentation
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Requested by:** Brady

## Overview
Keaton formulated 6 customer research hypotheses to validate Squad's investment thesis. McManus synthesized them into an executive-facing "Research Opportunities" section in the corporate summary document.

## What Happened
1. **Keaton (Research Lead):** Designed hypothesis portfolio (H1–H6) with research methods, timelines, costs (~$54–91K), and investment go/no-go criteria. Portfolio spans 16 weeks in 3 parallel phases. Success criteria: 3 of 4 core hypotheses confirmed = proceed with scaling.
2. **McManus (DevRel):** Synthesized Keaton's detailed methodology into executive summary format. Added "## Research Opportunities" section (lines 176–241) to `docs/squad-executive-summary.md` immediately before Caveats. Distilled 6 hypotheses to 4 core research priorities (H1–H4) with study designs, timelines, costs, and explicit investment decision thresholds.

## Key Decisions
- **Investment go/no-go gate:** H1 (task speed) + H3 (retention moat) confirmed = greenlight. H4 (ROI scaling) adds GTM clarity. Threshold: ≥3 of 4 confirmed.
- **Portfolio execution:** Phase 1 (H1+H2 parallel, weeks 1–8), Phase 2 (H3+H4 parallel, weeks 9–16), Phase 3 exploratory (H5+H6).
- **Budget:** ~$45–77K over 16 weeks (executive summary documents core 4; Keaton's detailed plan includes exploratory studies 5–6).

## Artifacts
- `docs/squad-executive-summary.md` — Updated with Research Opportunities section (McManus)
- `.ai-team/agents/keaton/research-hypotheses-draft.md` — Full methodology reference (Keaton)
