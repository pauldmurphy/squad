# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial assessment (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad is an npx CLI** that copies `squad.agent.md` (coordinator) and `templates/` into user repos, plus pre-creates `.ai-team/` directory structure (inbox, orchestration-log, casting).
- **Started with zero test coverage** — no test files, no framework, no CI. Key risk areas identified: symlinks, filesystem errors, incomplete installs, cross-platform paths, ANSI in non-TTY.
- **Test strategy evolved** from `tap` to `node:test` + `node:assert` (zero dependencies) — integration-heavy (80% integration, 20% unit), spawn `index.js` in isolated temp dirs.
- **Three non-negotiable tests**: init happy path, init idempotency, export/import round-trip. If any fail, don't ship.

## Recent Updates

📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Human directives persist via coordinator-writes-to-inbox pattern — no new infrastructure needed. — decided by Kujan
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Master Sprint Plan (Proposal 019) adopted — single execution document superseding Proposals 009 and 018. 21 items, 3 waves + parallel content track, 44-59h. All agents execute from 019. Wave gates are binary. — decided by Keaton
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): No npm publish — GitHub-only distribution. Kobayashi hired as Git & Release Engineer. Release plan (021) filed. Sprint plan 019a amended: item 1.8 cancelled, items 1.11-1.13 added.
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Release ritual — state integrity canary is a hard release gate. Tests + state canary + npx verify are automated gates. All must pass before release ships. — decided by Keaton
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Coordinator now captures user directives to decisions inbox before routing work. Directives persist to decisions.md via Scribe. — decided by Kujan
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Coordinator must acknowledge user requests with brief text before spawning agents. Single agent gets a sentence; multi-agent gets a launch table. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Silent success mitigation strengthened in all spawn templates — 6-line RESPONSE ORDER block + filesystem-based detection. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): .ai-team/ must NEVER be tracked in git on main. Three-layer protection: .gitignore, package.json files allowlist, .npmignore. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): If ask_user returns < 10 characters, treat as ambiguous and re-confirm — platform may fabricate default responses from blank input. — decided by Brady
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): PR #2 integrated — GitHub Issues Mode, PRD Mode, Human Team Members added to coordinator with review fixes (gh CLI detection, post-setup questions, worktree guidance). — decided by Fenster
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Documentation structure formalized — docs/ is user-facing only, team-docs/ for internal, .ai-team/ is runtime state. Three-tier separation is permanent. — decided by Kobayashi
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Per-agent model selection designed — 4-layer priority (user override → charter → registry → auto-select). Role-to-model mapping: Designer→Opus, Tester/Scribe→Haiku, Lead/Dev→Sonnet. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Tiered response modes shipped — Direct/Lightweight/Standard/Full modes replace uniform spawn overhead. Agents may now be spawned with lightweight template (no charter/history/decisions reads) for simple tasks. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Skills Phase 1 + Phase 2 shipped — agents now read SKILL.md files before working and can write SKILL.md files from real work. Skills live in .ai-team/skills/{name}/SKILL.md. Confidence lifecycle: low→medium→high. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): docs/ and CHANGELOG.md now included in release pipeline (KEEP_FILES, KEEP_DIRS, package.json files, .npmignore updated). Brady's directive. — decided by Kobayashi


📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Preview branch added to release pipeline — two-phase workflow: preview then ship. Brady eyeballs preview before anything hits main. — decided by Kobayashi

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): v0.3.0 sprint plan approved — per-agent model selection, team backlog, Demo 1. — decided by Keaton

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Tone directive consolidated — all public-facing material must be straight facts only. No editorial voice, sales language, or narrative framing. Stacks on existing banned-words and tone governance rules. — decided by bradygaster, McManus

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): CCA governance must be self-contained in squad.agent.md (cannot read .ai-team/). — decided by Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Proposal migration uses three-wave approach — active first, shipped second, superseded/deferred last. — decided by Keaton

## Learnings

- **CI/CD Workflow Tests (2026-02-11)** — **What I Did:**
  - Created `test/workflows.test.js` — 22 tests across 8 describe blocks covering the three CI/CD workflow templates (`squad-ci.yml`, `squad-preview.yml`, `squad-release.yml`).
  - **Tests cover:** template existence, YAML structural validity (name/on/jobs keys), init copies workflows to `.github/workflows/`, upgrade updates/overwrites stale workflows, trigger configuration checks (pull_request, push, main branch, preview branch), and byte-for-byte template-to-output matching for all workflow templates.
  - **Patterns used:** Same `node:test` + `node:assert/strict` pattern as existing test files. `execFileSync` with `NO_COLOR=1` in isolated temp dirs. `t.skip()` for graceful degradation when templates don't exist yet.
  - **Key design choice:** Tests use `t.skip()` when templates are missing so the suite stays green during parallel agent work (Kobayashi may not have finished yet). No external YAML parser — validity is checked via required key presence (`name:`, `on:`, `jobs:`).
  - All 22 workflow tests pass. Full suite (45 tests) green.

- **Init Mode Prompt Structure Tests (#66)** — **What I Did:**
  - Created `test/init-flow.test.js` — 8 tests across 5 describe blocks verifying the Init Mode prompt structure in the generated `squad.agent.md`.
  - **Tests cover:** (1) squad.agent.md generated with Init Mode section, (2) explicit STOP/WAIT gate between propose and create, (3) step 5 confirmation question exists, (4) confirmation step numbered before file creation step, (5) no file creation instructions between propose and confirm steps, (6) step 6 is conditional on confirmation, (7) ask_user referenced for confirmation.
  - **Results: 6 pass, 2 fail.** The 2 failures document the current broken behavior from #66:
    - **FAIL: "Init Mode contains a STOP or WAIT gate"** — No explicit STOP/WAIT instruction exists. The prompt has numbered steps but nothing telling the LLM to actually pause between step 5 (ask "Look right?") and step 6 (create files). LLMs execute all steps sequentially in one turn.
    - **FAIL: "ask_user referenced in Init Mode"** — The prompt never mentions `ask_user` or any explicit tool for getting confirmation. Without this, the LLM has no mechanism to yield control back to the user.
  - **Pattern: Prompt structure testing.** These are not runtime LLM behavior tests — they verify the text content of generated prompt files. The pattern is: run `node index.js` in a temp dir, read the generated `.github/agents/squad.agent.md`, extract sections by heading, assert on text patterns (regex + string search). This catches prompt regressions without needing an LLM in the loop.
  - **Key insight:** The current prompt relies on step numbering alone to create a pause point. Step 5 says "Ask: Look right?" and step 6 says "On confirmation, create..." — but without an explicit STOP instruction or ask_user reference, LLMs treat steps 4-6 as a single execution block. The fix needs both: (a) an explicit STOP/WAIT directive, and (b) an ask_user tool reference to force the LLM to yield.

📌 Team update (2026-02-15): Directory structure rename planned — .ai-team/ → .squad/ starting v0.5.0 with backward-compatible migration; full removal in v1.0.0 — Brady
