# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial architecture review and proposal-first design (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad uses distributed context windows** — coordinator at ~1.5% overhead, veteran agents at ~4.4%, leaving 94% for reasoning. This inverts the traditional multi-agent context bloat problem.
- **Architecture patterns**: drop-box for concurrent writes (inbox → Scribe merge), parallel fan-out by default (multiple `task` calls in one turn), casting system for persistent character names, memory compounding via per-agent `history.md`.
- **Proposal-first workflow governs all meaningful changes** — required sections (Problem → Solution → Trade-offs → Alternatives → Success Criteria) force complete thinking. 48-hour review timeline. Cancelled proposals kept as learning artifacts.
- **Key trade-offs**: coordinator complexity (32KB) is a maintenance surface; parallel execution depends on agents following shared memory protocols; casting adds personality at the cost of init complexity.
- **Compound decisions are the strategic model** — each feature makes the next easier. Proposals are the alignment mechanism that makes this possible.

### Session Summaries

- **2026-02-08: Portable Squads architecture (Proposal 008)** — **Core insight:** Squad conflates team identity with project context. Agent histories contain both user preferences (portable) and codebase knowledge 
- **2026-02-08: v1 Sprint Plan — synthesis and prioritization** — **Core insight:** v1 is three things: fast (latency), yours (portable), smart (skills). Everything serves one of those or it's cut. The sprint plan sy

- **2026-02-09: Shared state integrity audit — the bug is HERE** — **Context:** Brady asked the team to audit shared state integrity and scream if we see the silent success bug happening.
- **2026-02-08: Squad DM — Direct Messaging Interface architecture (Proposal 017)** — **Core insight:** Squad's terminal-only interface is a ceiling on how intimate the team relationship can be. Brady's MOLTS reference (multi-channel AI
- **2026-02-09: Wave-based execution plan (Proposal 018)** — **Core insight:** Brady's directive — quality then experience — requires reorganizing work by trust level, not by capability. Proposal 009's sprint st

- **2026-02-09: Master Sprint Plan — the definitive build plan (Proposal 019)** — **Core insight:** Brady asked for "all of it" — one document that supersedes everything. Proposal 019 synthesizes all 18 prior proposals, all team dec
- **2026-02-09: Sprint plan amendments — Brady's session 5 directives (Proposal 019a)** — **Core insight:** Brady's session 5 directives are mostly about the human experience of using Squad — not features, not architecture, but *how it feel
- **2026-02-09: No npm — GitHub-only distribution, release process, Kobayashi hired** — **Core insight:** Brady killed the npm publish model entirely. Squad is GitHub-only: `npx github:bradygaster/squad`. This is simpler than dual-publish
- **2026-02-08: Release ritual design — product-level input** — **Core insight:** A release ritual should be proportional to stakes. The 0.x ritual should take 5 minutes and under 10 checklist items. The 1.0 ritual
- **Stale proposals audit** — **Date:** Session post-019a
- **2026-02-08: PR #2 review — GitHub Issues mode, PRD mode, Human team members** — 📌 Team update (2026-02-09): If ask_user returns < 10 characters, treat as ambiguous and re-confirm — platform may fabricate default responses from bla
- **2026-02-10: Comprehensive Proposal Status Audit** — **What:** Audited all 25+ proposals in `team-docs/proposals/` and updated every status to match what actually shipped. 18 proposals marked "Approved ✅
- **2026-02-10: Critical Release Safety Audit for v0.2.0** — **Requested by:** Brady — needs 100% confidence that internal files never reach users via `npm publish` or `npx github:bradygaster/squad`.
- **Updated release-process.md: docs/ and CHANGELOG.md now ship** — Brady flagged that `docs/` and `CHANGELOG.md` should ship to main (and to users). Updated `team-docs/release-process.md` to reflect this:
- **2026-02-10: Final Architecture Review — Updated Release Pipeline (docs/ + CHANGELOG.md)** — **Verdict: YES — the updated release pipeline is architecturally sound.**

## Recent Updates

## Learnings

_Summarized 2026-02-10 learnings (full entries available in session logs):_

- **2026-02-10: Model Selection (024 consolidated)** — Merged 024+024a+024b into single spec. 4-layer selection priority, 16-model catalog condensed to 4 columns, nuclear fallback for resilience. Status: Approved ✅ for v0.3.0 Wave 1.
- **2026-02-10: v0.3.0 Sprint Plan (027)** — 4 bets: model selection, backlog capture, demo infra, GitHub Issue sync. 2 waves, 31-43h. v0.2.0 gave hands; v0.3.0 gives a brain. Cut aggressively: no Squad DM, no agent negotiation, no speculative execution.
- **2026-02-10: GitHub-Native Planning (028)** — 4-phase plan. Phase 1: one-way push of proposals/backlog to GitHub Issues (3-4h, prompt-only). Key: filesystem authoritative, GitHub is collaboration cache. Only proposals and backlog items sync; decisions/history/skills stay filesystem-only.
- **2026-02-10: 028 Phase 1 promoted to v0.3.0** — Brady overrode deferral. Low-risk prompt engineering, reuses PR #2 patterns. Learning: read risk profile, not just item count.
- **2026-02-10: Marketing Site (029)** — Jekyll on GitHub Pages, `docs/` as source root. No content reproduction. Classic mode, zero CI. Phase 1: 5-8h (McManus + Fenster).

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Model selection consolidated (024+024a+024b) — single approved spec for v0.3.0 Wave 1. — decided by Keaton
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): GitHub-native planning (028) Phase 1 promoted to v0.3.0 by Brady. — decided by Brady
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Model fallback resilience is mandatory — nuclear fallback guarantees no broken spawns. — decided by Brady
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Marketing site architecture decided — Jekyll on GitHub Pages, docs/ is the source root, no content reproduction. Phase 1: 5-8h. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-10): GitHub Issues/PR integration must not break CLI conversations — CLI is primary surface, GitHub integration is additive only. — decided by bradygaster
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Tone directive consolidated — all public-facing material must be straight facts only. No editorial voice, sales language, or narrative framing. Stacks on existing banned-words and tone governance rules. — decided by bradygaster, McManus

- **2026-02-10: Proposal 028 updated with spboyer/slidemaker reference implementation**
  - **Shayne Boyer (@spboyer) validated 028's design patterns end-to-end** using Squad to decompose a PRD into 9 GitHub Issues on [spboyer/slidemaker](https://github.com/spboyer/slidemaker). 8 of 9 completed and closed. This is the first external validation of the PRD→Issues pipeline.
  - **Formalized the `squad:` label convention:** Two-tier labeling — `squad` base label on every squad-managed issue, `squad:{agent-name}` for per-agent routing (e.g., `squad:verbal`, `squad:mcmanus`, `squad:fenster`). Validated with 9 issues across 3 agents in slidemaker. Updated both 028 and 028a to use this convention instead of the old `squad-agent` label.
  - **Standardized issue template:** User story format ("As a {persona}, I want {capability}, so that {benefit}") with checkbox acceptance criteria and agent metadata (Squad member, Primary work files, Dependencies) in a Notes section. All 9 slidemaker issues follow this pattern.
  - **Key architectural insight:** Agent metadata injection in issue bodies (Squad member name, role, file paths) eliminates the need for external routing logic. The issue IS the assignment. Labels handle filtering; body handles context.
  - **Key file paths:** `team-docs/proposals/028-github-native-team-planning.md` (Reference Implementation section added), `team-docs/proposals/028a-github-api-capabilities.md` (prerequisites label list updated).
