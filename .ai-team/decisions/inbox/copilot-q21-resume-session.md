### 2026-02-20: Q21 — resumeSession() for Ralph
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Assume `resumeSession()` works for Ralph's persistent monitoring use case. Build on it (option 1). Study SDK samples — persistent loop patterns exist. Exercise the API early; if it breaks, file bugs upstream. Good partnering signal.
**Why:** User decision — SDK Technical Preview. Early adoption surfaces bugs, builds relationship with SDK team. Ralph's persistent monitoring is a key differentiator — validate the API path rather than building our own.
