### 2026-02-13: go:/release: label automation

**By:** Fenster

**What:** Four-workflow system to automate `go:` (triage verdict) and `release:` (version target) label namespaces. Created `squad-label-enforce.yml` for mutual exclusivity enforcement; updated `sync-squad-labels.yml` to sync 8 static labels (3 go:, 5 release:); updated `squad-triage.yml` to apply `go:needs-research` as default verdict; updated `squad-heartbeat.yml` to detect issues missing go: labels and go:yes issues missing release: labels.

**Why:** Labels-as-automation is the foundation of Squad's GitHub-native workflow. The `go:` namespace (go:yes, go:no, go:needs-research) captures triage decisions; the `release:` namespace (release:v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v1.0.0, release:backlog) captures delivery targets. Mutual exclusivity is business logic (exactly 1 go: label per triaged issue, at most 1 release: label per issue). Workflows enforce this at runtime, eliminating human error. The enforcement workflow handles label transitions: when a new go: or release: label is applied, it removes conflicting labels in the same namespace and posts a comment (only on actual changes). Special cases: `go:yes` auto-applies `release:backlog` if no release target exists (every approved issue must have a target); `go:no` strips release labels (rejected issues shouldn't be in release planning). Default verdict (`go:needs-research`) is applied by triage workflow to ensure every triaged issue enters the system with a go: label. Ralph (heartbeat) now scans for label hygiene: issues missing go: labels are surfaced as incomplete triage, go:yes issues missing release: labels are surfaced as incomplete planning. This is textbook "agentic DevOps" — labels are the state machine, automation is the enforcement layer.
