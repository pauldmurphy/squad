### 2026-02-20: Q25 — Workflow path migration ownership
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Kobayashi (Git/Release) owns the .ai-team/ → .squad/ path migration across all 12 workflow templates. Mechanical find-and-replace with testing — squarely in his lane.
**Why:** User decision — clear ownership assignment. This is release infrastructure, not architecture. Kobayashi handles changelogs, tags, and workflow files already.
