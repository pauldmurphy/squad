**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** What's New docs structure — only the LATEST release's "What's New" block belongs in README.md. All release-by-release What's New blocks should be archived in a dedicated docs/whatsnew.md page. README links to it.
**Why:** User request — prevents README from growing unbounded as releases accumulate. Keeps README focused on current state. Captured for McManus follow-up.
