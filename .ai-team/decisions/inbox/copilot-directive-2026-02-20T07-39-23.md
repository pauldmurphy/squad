**What:** If we replatform on the SDK, everything is on the table. This is a chance to start from ground zero — take all the learnings from the current Squad and rebuild clean. No legacy baggage, no "we already have this so keep it." Super-duper clean.
**Why:** User request — green-field mindset for the replatforming proposal. The team should treat this as an opportunity to rethink the entire architecture, directory structure, naming, ceremony system, etc. with the benefit of hindsight.
